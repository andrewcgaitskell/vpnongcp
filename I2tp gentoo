Assumptions and example settings
For the purpose of this guide, the following assumptions (or sample settings) are used:

Domain is example.com
Server name is vpn.example.com
CA file is called ca.crt
Server cert is vpn.example.com.crt
Server key is vpn.example.com.key
Client cert is client.example.com.crt
Client key is client.example.com.key

the client is called the initiator and the server is called the responder

Option 3: strongSwan
strongSwan is a fork of FreeS/WAN (although much code has been replaced).

As of strongSwan 5.0, NAT traversal is automatic, no configuration is needed.

strongSwan does not create an ipsec.secrets file, thus one must be created:

root #touch /etc/ipsec.secrets && chmod 664 /etc/ipsec.secrets
PSK setup for strongSwan
A shared key must be created. It may either be specified by a quoted string or by a hex number. In the next example, PUT_VPN_SERVER_IP should be replaced by the server's IP address. The %any means that any client selector can authenticate using the given PSK.

FILE /etc/ipsec.secrets
PUT_VPN_SERVER_IP %any : PSK 0x87839cfdab5f74bc211de156d2902d128bec3243
# Or to use a plain text PSK instead of hex code:
# PUT_VPN_SERVER_IP %any : PSK "password_pass"
Next edit /etc/ipsec.conf as follows:

FILE /etc/ipsec.conf
conn vpnserver
        type=transport
        authby=secret
        pfs=no
        rekey=no
        keyingtries=1
        left=%any
        leftprotoport=udp/l2tp
        leftid=@vpn.example.com
        right=%any
        rightprotoport=udp/%any
        auto=add
When both left and right are set to %any, then strongSwan assumes the local machine is left.

Certificate based setup for strongSwan
The certificates and keys must be copied to the appropriate directories:

root #cp ca.crt /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts
root #cp vpn.example.com.crt /etc/ipsec.d/certs
root #cp vpn.example.com.key /etc/ipsec.d/private
root #chown -R ipsec: /etc/ipsec.d
Next, tell strongSwan to use public keys for the authentication:

FILE /etc/ipsec.secrets
: RSA vpn.example.com.key
Finally update the /etc/ipsec.conf file as follows:

FILE /etc/ipsec.conf
conn vpnserver
        type=transport
        authby=rsasig
        pfs=no
        rekey=no
        keyingtries=1
        left=%defaultroute
        leftprotoport=udp/l2tp
        leftcert=server.crt
        leftid=@vpn.example.com
        right=%any
        rightprotoport=udp/%any
        rightrsasigkey=%cert
        auto=add
As before, when both left and right are %any, strongSwan assumes the local machine is left.

Troubleshooting strongSwan
IPsec pass-through / broken NAT
In previous strongSwan versions, IPsec pass-through does not seem to work. It returns "cannot respond to IPsec SA request because no connection is known" or (which heavy editing of the config file) an INVALID_HASH_INFORMATION error. This may not be true anymore with strongSwan 5.0 or higher.
